# A history of spiels

Hopefully this elicits more laughs than groans... and yes, I've actually tried all of these.

## Spiel 1

a clean, simple form framework for react

- no mixin or decoration, just an api
- form state lives with your form component until the form is submitted with valid data
- designed to work with react controlled components
- framework simply provides props, you lay out your inputs
- comprehensive and feature complete

## Spiel 2

### a flexible, well-designed approach to [react forms](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)

there are a slew of react form packages out there. if you've managed to find this one, why should you use it?

- clean design allows for stateless input components - no mixin or decoration required.
- simple architecture encapsulates UI validation logic in your form component where it typically belongs.
- feature complete and fully tested - not a half-baked, half-finished library that will leave you hanging.
- seamlessly supports asynchronous validation and nested, reusable form components.

react-formstate allows you to compose elegant forms quickly and easily, without getting in your way. it saves you hassle and time while still providing effective extension points. in my opinion, no other package does this as successfully.

per the download counts this package has yet to catch on. please don't let that dissuade you. react-formstate is actively used and maintained. it only lacks in advertisement. if you have any feedback i am happy to hear it. thanks.

## Spiel 3

### a practical approach to react forms

react-formstate is an elegant productivity solution for react forms. it is simple in design, simple to use, and limited in focus. it streamlines form components without buckling under complex use cases. it is feature complete and fully tested.

react-formstate turned out even better than i expected. if you give it a try i think you'll be happy with the solution too.

if you have any feedback i am glad to hear it. thanks.

## Spiel 4

### A practical approach to React forms

react-formstate is a productivity solution for writing elegant and maintainable React forms.

## Spiel 5 (Decided to start capitalizing words properly, blasted shift key)

### A practical approach to React forms

If you are adding validation to a React form and you find yourself thinking - there must be a better way - that was the impetus behind react-formstate. Since React is all about responding to changes in component state, the key to a React-based solution is to provide an API to easily manage form state, specifically validation status. In doing so, you get productivity gains beyond validation. The end result is you keep your form components DRY.

react-formstate is a productivity solution for React forms that supports real-world, non-trivial use cases. It eliminates busy work without sacrificing flexibility.

react-formstate turned out even better than I expected. If you give it a try, I think you'll be happy with the solution too.

If you have any feedback I am happy to hear it. Thanks.

## Spiel 6

### An optimal productivity API for React forms

react-formstate streamlines form components using plain old setState and one-way binding. It's like building a form in raw React... minus the busy work.

    $ npm install react-formstate --save

It's a best-in-class solution with a focus on validation. Short of command pattern, **it will support your use case**.

## Spiel 7

### An optimal productivity API for React forms

react-formstate streamlines form components without imposing on your workflow. It relies almost exclusively on React's built-in support for one-way binding. In essence, it's a simple matter of auto-generating event handlers and allowing you to override them when necessary (as in, you surrender nothing in the bargain).

It's as lightweight as you can get, yet it does everything you'd want.

You can use it with setState or you can hook it up to Redux.

    $ npm install react-formstate --save

Since react-formstate is essentially building a form in raw React, it will support your use case.

It truly is an optimal API for React forms.

## Spiel 8 (The wheels come off for a day or two)

This project has failed to gain traction so I'm shutting it down.

For maintenance and historical reference, see the old readme

## Spiel 9 (Getting really ugly)

This is an active project despite the apparent lack of interest. If I felt there were a better solution to form validation in React, I would gladly point you to that solution.

In the meantime, if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Well... this is the sound of practically no one other than the author using this package. Does that mean it's not a good package?

## Spiel 10 (Trying to pull it together)

## Form validation in React

After a year and a half on NPM, looking at overall downloads and GitHub stars, this package has received lukewarm response at best, which is fine, if it deserves it. The thing I get stuck on, is when I analyze this package and compare it to alternative packages, I keep coming up with a favorable picture of this one, which is why I threw so much into trying to make it accessible and available to the community. So I'm curious to understand, in the eyes of the React community, how this is coming up short. If you are willing to provide feedback [here](https://github.com/dtrelogan/react-formstate/issues/10), you'd be helping me out a great deal. Thanks.

## Spiel 11 (Realizing my outburst was a mistake)

## Form validation in React

A productivity API for React forms.

# Sometimes you just have to laugh at yourself

I have a stubborn conviction that I'm onto something pretty good with this package and I'd like to be proven right through user acceptance. I also have a stubborn resistance toward marketing this in any way, which causes me frustration. For a day or two there I forgot that the most important thing is happy users and trust (I guess that's two things). With that in mind, looking at my attempts to pitch this over time is pretty funny.
