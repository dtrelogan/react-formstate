## a practical approach to react forms

react-formstate is an elegant productivity solution for react forms. it is simple in design, simple to use, and limited in focus. it streamlines form components without buckling under complex use cases. it is feature complete and fully tested.

react-formstate turned out even better than i expected. if you give it a try i think you'll be happy with the solution too.

if you have any feedback i am glad to hear it. thanks.

### a request

more users leads to better maintenance. to the best of my knowledge the only way to discover this package is via a search on npm, where it's easy for this package to get buried amongst dozens of others. i could attempt to promote my own package on stack overflow and the like, but i think it would be more meaningful coming from a satisfied user. so, if you think react-formstate is a good thing, i could use your help spreading the word in any way you think would help. or, if anyone knows how to do seo optimization to get this package to show up directly in a google search, that would obviously be a tremendous help. thanks for your time and consideration.
